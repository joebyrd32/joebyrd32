Hey I'm Joseph Byrd

I'm a recent graduate looking for work as a Software Developer.

You can check out some of my work here https://fullstack-webstore.herokuapp.com/
On this project I worked with 3 other people. I did most of the backend, about half 
of the unit testing, a small amount of the frontend and I deployed it.

Here is the code https://github.com/joebyrd32/WebStore
It was originally on another git account and we had about 200 commits

Thank you for your time
